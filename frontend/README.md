# NutrackerSpa

This is the front-end for NuTracker.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

We recommend running the dev server on port 80 by using `ng serve --port 80` for better cookie compatibility.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Tests are not yet defined but we plan on adding them soonTM

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Tests are not yet defined but we plan on adding them soonTM

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
