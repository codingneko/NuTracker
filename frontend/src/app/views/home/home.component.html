<p>
    NuTracker is a tracker for your nuts. You tell us when you nut, we save it
    in our shitty database in case you want to see how many times you nutted, or
    compare your nut rate with your friends. We have very shitty charts so it's
    kinda fucked to keep track of your nuts, but hey, at least the data is
    there.
