            h1 Welcome to NuTracker!
            p.mb-5.
                NuTracker is a tracker for your ğŸŒ°s. You tell us when you cum, we save it 
                in our shitty database in case you want to see how many times you ğŸŒ°ed a certain
                day. We have beautiful charts so it's easy to keep track of your ğŸŒ°s.
